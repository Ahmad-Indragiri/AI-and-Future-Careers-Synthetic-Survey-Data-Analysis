ðŸŽ“ Predicting AI Helpfulness for Academic Tasks â€” A Machine Learning mini project using survey data to predict students' perception of AI assistance. Includes preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model comparison, and tuning.

# ðŸ¤– AI Helpfulness Prediction â€“ Survey-Based ML Project

A mini project that builds a machine learning model to predict **how helpful AI is perceived in academic tasks** by students and professionals, based on synthetic survey data.

This project follows the **Machine Learning Life Cycle**, from problem definition to model tuning.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given responses from a synthetic survey on AI usage in education and work, can we predict how helpful AI is perceived in academic tasks? The target variable is `AI_Helpfulness_Academic_Tasks`, rated on a scale of 1 to 5.
